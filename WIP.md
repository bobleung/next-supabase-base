# Security Enhancements - Work In Progress

This document outlines security issues identified in the Next.js base project and recommendations for addressing them.

## Current Security Status

The application has a basic authentication and route protection mechanism using Supabase and Next.js middleware. While the foundation is solid, several important security measures are missing or incomplete.

## Security Issues to Address

### 1. Missing Input Validation ✅

**Issue:** Login and signup forms lack proper input validation.

**Risk:** Potential for injection attacks, malformed data, and security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Implemented frontend validation for immediate user feedback
- ✅ Added server-side validation in the auth action files using Zod

### 2. Missing Security Headers ✅

**Issue:** No explicit security headers configuration.

**Risk:** Various attacks including clickjacking, XSS, MIME-type sniffing, etc.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive security headers in next.config.ts
- ✅ Added Content Security Policy (CSP) with appropriate directives
- ✅ Created detailed documentation in docs/security/headers.md

### 3. Logout Implementation ✅

**Issue:** ~~No visible logout functionality.~~ (RESOLVED)

**Risk:** ~~Sessions remaining active after users are done, especially on shared computers.~~ (MITIGATED)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Implemented proper logout function in `/app/secure/profile/actions.ts`
- ✅ Added logout button in profile page
- ✅ Implemented secure server-side session termination

### 4. Basic Error Handling ⚠️

**Issue:** Generic error handling that redirects to `/error`.

**Risk:** Poor user experience and potential security information disclosure.

**Solution:**
- Create more specific error handling:

```typescript
// Create an error handling utility
// utils/error-handling.ts
export function handleAuthError(error: any) {
  console.error('Auth error:', error)
  
  if (error.message.includes('Email not confirmed')) {
    return { error: 'Please verify your email address' }
  }
  
  if (error.message.includes('Invalid login credentials')) {
    return { error: 'Invalid email or password' }
  }
  
  // Generic error message for other cases
  return { error: 'Authentication failed. Please try again.' }
}

// In login action
if (error) {
  return handleAuthError(error)
}
```

### 5. Password Policy ⚠️

**Issue:** No enforcement of password strength.

**Risk:** Weak passwords that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute forcing.

**Solution:**
- Add password strength requirements in validation:

```typescript
// Add to input validation
const signupSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  password: z.string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
    .regex(/[A-Z]/, "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
    .regex(/[a-z]/, "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter")
    .regex(/[0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one number")
    .regex(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one special character")
});
```

### 6. Rate Limiting ⚠️

**Issue:** No protection against brute force attacks.

**Risk:** Vulnerability to password guessing and denial of service attacks.

**Solution:**
- Implement API rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Consider using a middleware solution like `express-rate-limit` if using API routes
- For server actions, implement a custom rate limiting solution using Redis or similar technology

### 7. Session Management ⚠️

**Issue:** No explicit session timeout or forced re-authentication for sensitive operations.

**Risk:** Prolonged sessions could be hijacked or abused.

**Solution:**
- Set session timeouts in Supabase configuration
- Implement re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Add functionality to require password confirmation for critical actions

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical (Implement First)**
   - ✅ Input Validation
   - ✅ Proper Logout Function
   - ✅ Security Headers

2. **High Priority**
   - ⚠️ Better Error Handling
   - ⚠️ Password Policy
   - ⚠️ Performance Optimization of Security Measures

3. **Medium Priority**
   - ⚠️ Rate Limiting
   - ⚠️ Session Management

## Next Steps

1. Implement the critical security measures first
2. Add automated security testing
3. Consider regular security audits
4. Document security practices for future contributors

## Completed Security Enhancements
- ✅ CSRF Protection: Using Next.js Server Actions and Supabase's built-in protection
- ✅ Input Validation: Added comprehensive client and server-side validation using Zod
- ✅ Logout Functionality: Implemented secure logout with proper session termination
- ✅ Security Headers: Implemented all six essential security headers with balanced CSP configuration

### 8. Performance Issues with Security Implementation ⚠️

**Issue:** Security measures are causing significant performance slowdowns in local development.

**Risk:** Poor user experience, long page load times, and potential timeout issues in production.

**Solution:**
- Investigate and optimize the following areas:

1. **Middleware Overhead**:
   - Review middleware execution flow to reduce redundant authentication checks
   - Implement efficient caching for authentication status
   - Consider using more lightweight authentication checks for static or less sensitive routes

2. **Security Header Optimization**:
   - Review the CSP configuration to simplify directives where possible
   - Consider different CSP policies for development vs. production environments
   - Evaluate if all headers are needed for all routes

3. **Route Protection Efficiency**:
   - Streamline the authentication flow to reduce repeated checks
   - Consider implementing a more efficient way of checking authentication state
   - Use Next.js caching mechanisms more effectively for authenticated routes

4. **Authentication State Management**:
   - Store authentication state more efficiently to reduce redundant validation
   - Implement a more optimized token refreshing strategy
   - Consider JWT verification optimizations

5. **Service Role Key Configuration**:
   - Ensure the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable is properly set
   - Verify that admin operations aren't causing timeouts due to missing configuration

6. **Next.js Configuration Review**:
   - Consider optimizing the Next.js configuration for development performance
   - Review any custom server configurations that might be impacting performance
